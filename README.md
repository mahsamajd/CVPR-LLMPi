# CVPR-LLMPi

**CVPR-LLMPi** explores the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices like the Raspberry Pi 5 through efficient post-training quantization techniques (Q2, Q4, Q6, Q8).  
The project focuses on enabling real-time inference while optimizing energy efficiency and maintaining model accuracy.

## üìö Project Overview
- Post-training quantization (PTQ) of Large Language Models (LLMs) including Phi-3, Gemma, and Llama-3 across multiple bit-widths (Q2, Q4, Q6, Q8)
- Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) applied to BitNet models (ternary quantization, Q1.58)
- Benchmarking model performance using Tokens per Second (TPS), Tokens per Joule (TPJ), and Words per Battery Life (W/BL)
- Evaluation of quantization impact on semantic coherence using NUBIA scores
- Real-world deployment and energy measurements on Raspberry Pi 5.
- Trade-off analysis between model accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency for edge AI applications
